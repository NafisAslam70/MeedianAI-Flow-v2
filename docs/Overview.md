# Meedian Flow Overview

Meedian Flow is a day-to-day operations workspace that keeps every team member on the same schedule, on the same tasks, and accountable for how the day starts and ends. It brings together planning, attendance, task follow-up, and live collaboration in one browser experience.

**Who it serves**
- Executives and site administrators use the Manage Meedian area to shape programs, routines, and compliance rules.
- Team managers use the Managers Common hub to assign work, review progress, and resolve issues the moment they appear.
- Frontline members rely on the Member Dashboard to know what to do next, record their presence, and close their day with evidence.

**Daily rhythm**
1. Start the day in My Meed Rituals to open the day, run scannable entry codes, and confirm that required moderators are live.
2. Work through the Shared Dashboard, where the Deep Calendar timeline, Assigned Tasks view, and Routine Tracker keep everybody on pace.
3. Use Work Together for live co-working, video huddles, shared notes, and quick status updates.
4. Capture departures and returns through the Gate area and mark session attendance through the Take Attendance scanner.
5. Close the day in Close My Day, reviewing outcomes, reflection notes, and pending approvals before submitting day close.

**Why companies adopt Meedian Flow**
- A single source of truth for routines, schedules, duties, and attendance.
- Clear visibility for managers, with approvals, ticketing, and escalations handled in Managers Common.
- Members stay engaged through contextual prompts, checklists, and a guided day-close flow.
- Reporting surfaces automatically through My Performance and the manager reports suite, giving leadership early warning on adherence.

**Custom fit for each client**
- Programs, slots, and routine definitions are configured in Manage Meedian > Programs, Daily Slot Management, and Meta Roles so every division follows its own playbook.
- Day open and day close windows, forms, and required evidence are set in Manage Day Close and the day-close configuration tabs.
- The navigation brand block, welcome copy, and shared imagery live in the Navbar and public asset library, ready to swap for each company’s colors and logo.

The result is an operations command center that keeps every role aligned from open to close, captures proof of work automatically, and adapts as each client’s routines evolve.
