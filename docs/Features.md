- **Schedule orchestration** – The Deep Calendar timeline and Active Block view on the Shared Dashboard map each block of the day so members know where to be and moderators can see who is live.
- **Day opening** – My Meed Rituals guides moderators through launching routines, generating scannable entry codes, and confirming attendance before work begins.
- **Attendance capture** – The Take Attendance scanner, the Gate in-out station, and the session logs inside the My Meed Rituals execute modal record proof that people arrived, stepped out, or returned.
- **Live collaboration** – Work Together brings video huddles, shared music, and the My Notes overlay into one screen for remote or hybrid co-working.
